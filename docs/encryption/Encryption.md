# Encryption
This abstract class contains necessary components for generating *encryption
keys*.

## Fields
### CIPHER_TRANSFORM
```java
protected final String CIPHER_TRANSFORM = "AES/GCM/NoPadding"
```
Defines the encryption algorithm for ciphers.

### KEY_ALGO
```java
private static final String KEY_ALGO = "PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256";
```
Defines the encryption algorithm 

### KEY_PASSWORD
```java
private static final String KEY_PASSWORD = "<some password>";
```
Defines the PBKDF2 password

### KEY_SPEC_ITER
```java
private static final int KEY_SPEC_ITER = 65536;
```
Defines how many iterations the encryption will go through.

### KEY_SPEC_LEN
```java
private static final int KEY_SPEC_LEN = 256;
```
Defines the KeySpec length.

### data
```java
protected String data;
```
The data to be encrypted.

### key
```java
protected SecretKey key;
```
The `SecretKey` to be generated by this class.

### salt
```java
protected byte[] salt;
```
The salt of the encryption

> [!INFO]
> A salt is basically a random set of bytes/characters that is concatenated to
> the text being encrypted before it is encrypted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is important that the decoder will have the same salt as the encryptor.

### iv
```java
protected byte[] iv;
```
The Initialization Vector (IV) of the encryption

> [!INFO]
> IVs add randomness to the start of the encryption process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is important that the decoder will have the same IV as the encryptor.

## Methods

### initKey()
```java
protected void initKey()
```
The method that generates the SecretKey
