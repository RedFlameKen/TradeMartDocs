# Server
Along with the mobile app, a
[server](https://github.com/RedFlameKen/TradeMartServer) for it is also being
developed. The server is written in java, built with Spring Boot. The mobile
app communicates with the server through [HTTP endpoints](endpoints.md).
[`RequestUtil`](/request/RequestUtil.md) may be used to access these endpoints.
